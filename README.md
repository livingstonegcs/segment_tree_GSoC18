# segment_tree_GSoC18
This is a mini library (header) in c++ for the generic implementation of segment trees.
The file 'segmentTree.hpp' is the header.

The 2 naive tests are provided for showing how it works:
1. 'dummytest_int_arr.cpp' is a small test program which shows Range Sum Query.
2. 'dummytest_string_arr.cpp' is another test program which demonistrates the usage of string concatenation as a range query.
